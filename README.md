## Coding Best Practice

This site was coded using SMACSS, OOCSS and BEM methodology.

### BEM

BEM is a methodology that makes coding large websites easy. BEM standards for Block, Element, Modifier. BEM gives developers and designer a system that it's easy to understand across teams thus improving development and communication throughout the project.  BEM allows teams to understand the structure by simply looking at the code. 

* B - Block can be a literal block in your code
* E - Element is an element child of the block
* M - Modifier is when a block or element change its behavior or look

### SMACSS 

SMACSS is a methodology used to reduce depth of applicability or the number of generations that are affected by a given rule.

* don't use descendent selectors
* use a sub-class when creating a variation of a module
* use classes and child selectors
* use cascading for themes and don't change class names
* don't use IDs as it'll create specificity complexity
